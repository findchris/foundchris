I came across a reference to a <code>script/console</code> session that looked like this:

<script src='http://pastie.org/494602.js'></script>

Sweet.  I had never heard of <code>ActionController::Integration::Session</code>, but now this little gem will be a regular tool for me for testing controller requests.
