I follow <a href="http://twitter.com/TheDelicious" target="_blank">@TheDelicious</a> along with many other LA food-types.  I live in LA and like food; it's what I do.

One afternoon, I happen to see a tweet from her mentioning a ticket give-away to a <a href="http://twitter.com/thejgold" target="_blank">Jonathan Gold</a> and linking to <a href="http://www.thedeliciouslife.com/2009/09/jonathan-golds-cocktail-party-another-pair-of-tickets-if-you-describe-yourself-in-five-words-or-fewer/" target="_blank">this blog post</a>.  So I followed the directions and tweeted, and forgot about it.  Then I got a DM from Sarah (TheDelicious) linking to <a href="http://www.thedeliciouslife.com/2009/09/you-are-hungry-thirsty-appreciative-idealistic-and-going-to-jonathan-golds-cocktail-party/" target="_blank">this post</a>, which I correctly presumed would be announcing the winner.  I hadn't presumed I'd won the contest though, and I did!  This has to be one of the first contests I'd ever won, and it was a good one to win if you live in LA and like food.  Details of the party can be found on the <a href="http://www.zocalopublicsquare.org/union_station_event/" target="_blank">Zocalo Public Square site</a>, but in summary:  Some of LA's top restaurants and bars provide finger foods and creative libations, while you listen to soothing latin music, enjoy a panel discussion featuring Jonathan Gold and several key players in LA's restaurant/bar scene.  All of this is $500 value that is helping raise funds for Zocalo.  Awesome right?

The night was excellent and I'll simply share some pictures rather than write much of the experience.  I will mention my favorite dish both for flavor and for originality:  Bacon-wrapped Matzo Balls with Horseradish aioli, courtesy of "<a href="http://www.thegorbalsla.com/" target="_blank">The Gorbals</a>."
