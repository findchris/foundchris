I forget the source, but I somehow came across <a href="http://www.lataco.com/taco/taco-madness-2009-taco-tournament" target="_blank">this blog post</a> on <a href="http://www.lataco.com/" target="_blank">lataco.com</a>.  A tournament of tacos from LA's best tacquerias:  I had to participate.

Work got in the way of participating in the actual event, so a few of us from <a href="http://www.socialvibe.com" target="_blank">SocialVibe</a> finally got our act together and picked a few accessible taquerias to compete in a Friday morning Taco Royal Rumble.

The contenders for our first round:  <a href="http://www.titostacos.com/" target="_blank">Tito's Tacos</a>, <a href="http://www.ta-comiendo.com/" target="_blank">Tacomiendo</a>, <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-por-favor-santa-monica" target="_blank">Tacos Por Favor</a>, and <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/el-taurino-los-angeles" target="_blank">El Taurino</a>.

When the contenders arrived at work this morning, we took over the sales desks, setting up a taco picnic.

The four of us judges (<a href="http://twitter.com/findchris" target="_blank">@findchris</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jessealbini" target="_blank">@jessealbini</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/hapaboy" target="_blank">@hapaboy</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/countzen" target="_blank">@countzen</a>) each took one taco from each contender, and did some synchronized tasting.

<strong>Tacos Por Favor</strong>

First on the tasting menu was Tacos Por Favor.  See for yourself:

These were a strong opener, and a great basic taco.  That's what we thought until we tried...

<strong>El Taurino</strong>

Contrasted with Tacos Por Favor, El Taurino's tacos had a more complex flavor palette.  There is a subtle lime note that really added to the overall flavor profile.  These carne asada tacos needed no salsa beyond the light drizzle of salsa roja applied by default.

Tacos Por Favor were good, but only after contrasting them with El Taurino did the judges unanimously agree that El Taurino had the better asada taco.

<strong>Tacomiendo</strong>

After tasting the perfectly complete flavor profile of the El Taurino tacos, the completely plain asada tacos from Tacomiendo seemed a hopeless contender.  The flavor of the carne asada alone was surprisingly good, enhanced further by some salsa verde.  Although the taco as a whole could not defeat El Taurino, the judges agreed that the meat from Tacomiendo was the best of the lot.

<strong>Tito's Tacos</strong>

DISCLOSURE:  I grew up in Culver City and have always loved the distinct fried corn tortilla shell of Tito's, despite a strong and vocal anti-Tito's contingent (see the <a href="http://www.yelp.com" target="_blank">Yelp</a> <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/titos-tacos-culver-city" target="_blank">reviews</a>).  The chips and salsa from Tito's stand out from the lightweight and unremarkable selection in the field, although we (the Taco judges) were not going to be making any decisions based on chips.

One look at tacos from Tito's reveals that these are not your traditional Mexican soft taco.  The soft, shredded beef is fried <em>inside</em> of the corn tortilla shell, locking in flavor and juices.  Shredded iceberg lettuce and lots of coarsely shredded cheese top each taco.

I personally consider it a requirement to put a ton of Tito's blended salsa on top of each taco, as the stuff is so tasty you can literally drink it (I have been known to do this upon occasion).

<strong>The Votes</strong>

Although they look like something from Taco Bell, three of the four taco judges voted Tito's "best tasting", with one judge giving his vote to El Taurino.  Everyone agreed that the award for "Most Classic Mexican Taco" went to El Taurino.

Who knows when Taco Tournament Round 2 will occur, but results will be posted here.
