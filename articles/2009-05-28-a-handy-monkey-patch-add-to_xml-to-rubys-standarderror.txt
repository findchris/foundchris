While working on some error handler refactoring in a Rails app, I added this bit of code to my application controller (application.rb):

<script src="http://pastie.org/493455.js"></script>

Then I found that the method StandardError#to_xml that I expected to be defined, actually was not.  So I put this into an initializer:

<script src='http://pastie.org/493458.js'></script>

Itch scratched!
