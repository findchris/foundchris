Today is my 29th birthday.<img class="alignright" title="Last piece of cake" src="http://farm4.static.flickr.com/3128/2782694646_beae7aa8cc_m.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="180" />

And today is my inaugural blog post on <a href="http://foundchris.com">foundchris.com</a>.

I hear chatter through various <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=blogging+dead">channels</a> that <a href="http://www.roughtype.com/archives/2008/11/who_killed_the.php">blogging</a> <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/is_blogging_dead.php">is</a> <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/allyson-kapin/radical-tech/blogging-dead">dead</a>.  Yeah yeah:  The era of independent authors writing interesting articles and getting traffic via a grassroots meritocracy has ended.  Most <a href="http://technorati.com/pop/blogs/">successful</a> blogs are online magazines, part of a blog network that churn out posts that constantly demand <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">PageRank</a>'s attention.  If not an online magazine, the only other blogs that gain prominence are those of industry <a href="http://scobleizer.com/">luminaries</a>.  The party's over.
